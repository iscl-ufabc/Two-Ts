<h1 align="center"><i>Two-Ts</i> Robotic Head</h1>

## Description
<p align="justify"> 
A robotic head has a key role in exchanging information to indicate its emotional state or communicate during an interaction. Therefore, the main target of this work is to present the open-source and low-cost robot head, known as <i>Two-Ts</i>, which is developed using 3D printing technology. Its main feature is to reproduce, even with mechanical limitations, the six basic and universal emotions created according to the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), such as happiness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, and sadness. 
 
The ethics committee of the Federal University of ABC approved the development of the <i>Two-Ts</i> (Certificate of Presentation for Ethical Consideration – CPEC n: 29671020.1.0000.5594).

## Simulation and Experimental Results

<p align="justify"><b>a) Basic Moviments:</b> Two-Ts’ eyes move left and right in the videos, and the eyebrows move up and down. Furthermore, the head movements are left, right, up, down, a small head tilts to left and right, and the partial and complete jaw opening.</p>

## Files

<b>a) CAD-3D:</b> 

+ [<b>Skull_Two-Ts.mix:</b>](https://encurtador.com.br/kuJN8) file created in the Autodesk Meshmixer to manipulate the skull meshes to ensure better CAD-3D quality and accuracy;
+ [<b>Virtual_Two_Ts.f3z:</b>](https://encurtador.com.br/diFGV) the structural/mechanical design of the A Virtual <i>Two-Ts</i> was developed in Autodesk Fusion 360. 

<b>b) Basic Movements and Emotions:</b>

+ [<b>BasicMovements_Real_TwoTs.py:</b>](https://encurtador.com.br/asxJT) code used in the experiment that showed the basic movements of the Real <i>Two-Ts</i>;
+ [<b>Emotions_Real_TwoTs.py:</b>](https://encurtador.com.br/bvNT6) code used in the experiment that showed the emotions of the Real <i>Two-Ts</i>; 
+ [<b>BasicMovements_Emotions_Virtual_TwoTs.py:</b>](https://encurtador.com.br/jquy3) code used in the simulation that showed the basic moviments and emotions of the Vitual <i>Two-Ts</i>.

<b>c) Google Collaboratory (Colab):</b>

+ [<b>Colab_Two_Ts.ipynb:</b>](https://encurtador.com.br/tGRY7) a system was implemented to identify the Action Units (AUs) and their intensity in each emotion and compare the results found on the face of Tamires with the Virtual and Real <i>Two-Ts</i>.
